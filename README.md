pyturn-battle
=============

A Python framework for turn based battle games that we developed for a college project. 

Includes a sample implementation, ElectionGame, a silly little representation of the 2012 US presidential election.

Will be left as is for some time, while we're busy with our final year. May see some polish and further development
in the future. Contact us anytime with questions or queries though.

Good Luck!
