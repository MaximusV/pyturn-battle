\section{Narrative}
You and a small team of friends have decided to construct an open-source framework/engine for turn based, party-centric battle games. A sample implementation should be included to help other developers understand the framework. 

\section{Requirements}
	\subsection{Functional}
	\begin{itemize}
			\item{A system for two or more ‘parties’ of at least one character to engage in some form of turn based competition.}
			\item{Each party member takes a turn in the competition, during which they can perform set actions.}
			\item{Party members have their own individual attributes that influence their performance and possibly the turn order.}
			\item{An interface for at least one player to interact with the system, controlling one or more party members, allowing for action selection, result output and display of game state.}
			\item{A method of storing game state and predetermined gameplay variables.}
			%\item{A method of persisting game state if program is ended and allowing the player to continue from that state when the program is run again.}
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Non-Functional}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Portability}
		\item{Extensibility}
		\item{Interoperability}
		\item{Quality}
		\item{Comprehensibility}
	\end{itemize}

\section{Architectural Use Cases}
	\subsection{Asynchronous rock, paper, scissors game}
	Developer wants to create a game for two people to play the rock, paper, scissors game together on the same computer, taking turns to enter their choice and then evaluating a winner as though the choices had taken place at the same time. 
	\subsection{Monster battle game (in the style of Pok\'{e}mon\textregistered)}
	Developer wants to create a game where the player controls a group of monsters in battles with other groups of monsters. Each monster has a number of moves they can perform, but each move can only be performed a certain number of times during a single battle. Each turn, the player can choose to switch out their monster or make a move. The game is won when one player’s monsters are all incapacitated.
	\subsection{Digital implementation of trading card type games}
	Developer wants a game where players can take turns placing cards on a virtual table, similar to games like Magic: the Gathering. Cards can have various effects on either player, such as increasing or decreasing their ‘life’ score, allowing them to draw extra cards from a deck, etc.
